# Engineering Fundamentals

> *"We don't calculate to find the answer; we calculate to verify the AI."*

In the past, engineers were human calculators. Today, we are **validators**. This module teaches you the core principles so you can look at an AI-generated solution and know if it will stand or collapse.

## Metal Collar Focus
- **Math as Verification**: Understanding Calculus to verify AI's physics simulations.
- **First Principles**: Physics never changes. We use it to ground AI's hallucinations.

## Topics
- **Mathematics**: Calculus, Linear Algebra (The language of AI).
- **Physics**: Mechanics, Electricity (The laws of the physical world).
- **Technical Drawing**: Reading blueprints that AI generates.
