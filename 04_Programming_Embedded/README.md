# Programming & Embedded Systems

> *"The Code is the Mind, The Chip is the Brain."*

In the age of AI, we don't just write code; we **architect** it. This module focuses on using AI to generate robust C++ drivers while we focus on the hardware integration.

## Metal Collar Focus
- **AI-Assisted Coding**: Using LLMs to generate boilerplate, drivers, and algorithms.
- **Prompt Engineering for Embedded**: How to ask AI to write optimized C code for STM32.
- **Logic over Syntax**: We stop memorizing syntax and start mastering system logic.

## Topics
- **Programming Languages**:
    - **C/C++**: The language of the machine. AI writes it, we verify detailed memory management.
    - **Python**: For scripting, AI/ML models on Edge, and data analysis.
- **Microcontrollers**:
    - **STM32/ARM**: Professional industrial standard.
    - **ESP32**: IoT and wireless control.
- **Edge AI**: Running TinyML models directly on microcontrollers.
