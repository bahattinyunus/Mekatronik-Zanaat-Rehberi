# Control Systems & Robotics

> *"Perfect Maths meets Real-World Chaos."*

Traditional automation is rigid. The "Metal Collar" technician uses AI to make it adaptive.

## Metal Collar Focus
- **Technician 2.0**: Using AI to decode complex fault logs and suggest repairs instantly.
- **Predictive Maintenance**: Using data to fix machines before they break.
- **Adaptive Control**: Moving beyond fixed PID to AI-driven control loops.

## Topics
- **Control Theory**: Understanding stability so we can trust AI's parameters.
- **Robotics Kinematics**: Visualizing movement; letting AI handle the matrix math.
- **Industrial Robotics**: KUKA, ABB programming.
- **Automation Systems**: Integrating AI agents into SCADA and PLCs.
